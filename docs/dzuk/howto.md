# Input (`-i`)`

The folder where the source images are located.

# Output (`-o`)

Where forc outputs to.

# Manifest (`-m`)

A file where you set all of your emoji metadata.

Documentation on manifests coming soon.


# Filter (`-e`) (optional)

Set a conditions for what emoji in your input will actually get exported. Useful if you just want to export a slice of what you've got in your input and manifest.


# Output parameters

forc can export your stuff into two things: **images** and **data**. The parameters you use will differ.

----

## Image output

There are two different methods to export images in orxporter:

### [Simple method](image_easy.md)

For beginners and light users.

This method purely uses the command line to create exports.


### [Slightly more advanced method](image_advanced.md)

For those who need to make heavy use of orxporter.

This method uses a .orx file to outline export types, enabling you to ask orxporter to compile more export types within a single go than you would be with command line arguments.


-----

## Data output

### JSON export (`-j`, `-J`) (optional)

Compile the metadata you've set in .orx files into a JSON file for web and other applications.

Filters done with `-e` still apply to this export.

Using this means that you're just exporting JSON for this command, you can't use the image-related stuff here.

- `-j`: JSON file with a flat structure.
- `-J`: JSON with a specific format expected by the Mutant Standard website (lol)

----

# [Metadata](metadata.md)

forc can embed SVG or EXIF metadata into your exported emoji sets.

---

# Extra flags

## Force Text Descriptions (`--force-desc`)

Makes orxporter complain if there are any emoji with missing text descriptions.


## Check SVG image size (`-q`) (optional)

Check the size of your SVG's `viewBox` attribute to make sure there are no accidents in export.

This won't work if your SVGs don't have this attribute.
