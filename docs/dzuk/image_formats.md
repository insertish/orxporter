# Formats

### Vector
- `svg` SVG
- `svgo` Optimised SVG (requires svgcleaner)

*(check the [readme](../../readme.md) for all the information on dependencies)*

#### `svgo` Optimised SVG
Optimised SVG is the same format as SVG, but it's losslessly compressed to create a smaller file size. It requires an extra processing stage (which is very cheap on CPU), and it needs the dependency listed. Check the [svgcleaner](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/svgcleaner) repo to see the documentation for it so you can see what it does to the SVG files.

orxporter uses svgcleaner with the following command:

`svgcleaner <in file> <out file> --remove-metadata=no --quiet`

In Mutant Standard tests, optimised SVGs are 30-40% smaller than normal SVGs. Unless you're doing something in particular, it's probably worth using Optimise SVGs by default instead of SVGs in your workflow.


### Raster
- `png` PNG
- `pngc` Crushed PNG (requires oxipng)
- `webp` Lossless WebP (requires cwebp)
- `avif` Lossless AVIF (requires go-avif)
- `flif` FLIF (requires flif)

*(check the [readme](../../readme.md) for all the information on dependencies)*

When choosing raster images, you have to add a size as well. you do this by adding a hyphen followed by the square size in pixels.

eg.

```
flif-32
avif-128
webp-512
png-60
```

#### `pngc` Crushed PNG
Crushed PNG is the same format as PNG, but it's losslessly compressed to create a smaller file size. It requires an extra processing stage (which can be quite expensive on CPU at very large sizes like 512px), and it needs the dependency listed. Check the [oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng) repo to see the documentation for it so you can see what it does to the PNG files.

orxporter uses oxipng with the following command:

`oxipng <in file> --out, <out file> --quiet`

In Mutant Standard tests, Crushed PNGs have a file size reduction of about 25% compared to normal PNGs, but only on larger sizes (128px upwards).
At 32px, crushing PNGs only has an average file size reduction of 3%.
